        <p>Dear Dr. Baumann:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="body">
        <p>It is my pleasure to submit my application for the Masters of Fine Arts in Writing program at Lindenwood University. As an upcoming May 2025 graduate of Lindenwood University with a bachelor's degree in English with an emphasis in creative writing, this MFA program is the perfect next step in achieving my goal of becoming both a published novelist and a university professor.</p>

        <p>During my time in the undergraduate program at Lindenwood University, I have been able to expand and refine the creative and academic writing skills I first developed while studying at St. Charles Community College. I have been published creatively in several literary journals for both poetry and short stories, as well as being published academically in The Confluence. I expect to graduate Summa Cum Laude as well as with university honors from completing the honors program. I have chosen the MFA program at Lindenwood because of the option to focus on fiction writing, the reputation of the program and the instructors, and the wide range of courses offered.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or if there is any additional information or documents I can provide. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
